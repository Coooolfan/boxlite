# 01 Getting Started

Start here.  These examples cover the two most common box types and basic
runtime introspection.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_simplebox.py` | Command execution, env vars, working dirs, error handling |
| `run_simplebox_sync.py` | Same as above, synchronous API |
| `run_codebox.py` | Run untrusted Python code safely in a CodeBox |
| `run_codebox_sync.py` | Same as above, synchronous API |
| `list_boxes.py` | List all active boxes and inspect metadata |

**Recommended first example:** `run_simplebox.py`

```bash
python examples/python/01_getting_started/run_simplebox.py
```
