# Build BoxLite core runtime and upload artifacts.
#
# This workflow builds the Rust runtime and populates the shared cache.
# On push to main: builds and caches (existing behavior).
# On release: builds and uploads runtime tarballs to GitHub Release.
#
# Platform-specific considerations:
# - Linux: Uses manylinux_2_28 container for glibc compatibility
#   - Guest binary built on host first (Ubuntu has musl-tools, manylinux doesn't)
#   - Shim/libkrun built in container (needs glibc 2.28)
# - macOS: Builds directly on runner (ARM64 only)
#
# Note: SDK workflows (build-wheels, build-node) are self-contained
# and trigger independently on release.
